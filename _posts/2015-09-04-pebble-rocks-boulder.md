> On Friday, September 4, seventy-five bold participants used Pebble Time smartwatches, Lulzbot 3D printers, and their own wits to vcreate something physical, something new, something kickass.

Check out the [official site](http://pebblerocksboulder.com/), [projects](https://www.hackster.io/hackathons/pebble-rocks-boulder/a-pebble-hackathon/projects), [video recap](https://vimeo.com/138805621), and [Flickr album](https://www.flickr.com/photos/23rdstudiosboulder/albums/72157657803685160) for a feel of what went down.  Full write-up forthcoming... :sweat_smile:
